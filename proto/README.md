# QmallC

Now Serving: **Protocol Version 16**

Protobuf files are hosted at [https://buf.build/dim4egster/avalanche](https://buf.build/dim4egster/avalanche) and can be used as dependencies in other projects.

Protobuf linting and generation for this project is managed by [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf).

Please find installation instructions on [https://docs.buf.build/installation/](https://docs.buf.build/installation/) or use `Dockerfile.buf` provided in the `proto/` directory of AvalancheGo.

Any changes made to proto definition can be updated by running `protobuf_codegen.sh` located in the `scripts/` directory of AvalancheGo.

## Protocol Version Compatibility

The protobuf definitions and generated code are versioned based on the [protocolVersion](../vms/rpcchainvm/vm.go#L21) defined by the rpcchainvm.
Many versions of an Qmall client can use the same [protocolVersion](../vms/rpcchainvm/vm.go#L21). But each Qmall client and subnet vm must use the same protocol version to be compatible.
